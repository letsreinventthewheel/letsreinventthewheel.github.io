We’re starting with an empty GitHub and LeetCode profile, exploring backend,
frontend, and interview prep. The goal is to recreate existing tools and ideas
to truly understand how they work. No fixed roadmap — just hands-on projects
that challenge and teach&lt;/p&gt;

<p>That’s what this journey is all about. We’re here to learn, inspect, and recreate
existing tools, libraries, and ideas - not just for the sake of it, but to build
real knowledge. And along the way, we’re going to document everything, growing a
GitHub profile that is a collection of all sorts of projects, a showcase of what
we’ve learned and built. A portfolio that could, one day, help land a job.</p>
<p>But right now? <strong>We’re starting from zero</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>📂 No repositories.</li>
<li>📝 No solved LeetCode problems.</li>
<li>🛠️ No half-finished projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just a blank slate and an open-ended path forward.</p>
<h2><a href="#what-this-is-all-about" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="what-this-is-all-about"></a>What This Is All About</h2>
<p><em>Let’s Reinvent the Wheel</em> isn’t about following a fixed roadmap or gradually increasing
difficulty. Some projects will be simple, others more complex. One day, we might build a
tiny utility. Another day, we could dive deep into a couple month long project.</p>
<p>We’re not locked into a single vertical - sometimes we’ll be in backend, other times frontend,
sometimes we’ll explore what it’s like to prepare for technical interviews using LeetCode.
After all, one of our goals with this GitHub journey is to create a strong profile that
could actually help us land a job.</p>
<p>And here’s something important: <strong>we’re not trying to invent brand-new things</strong>. A lot of what
we’ll build will be inspired by or directly rebuilt based on existing work. Because the best
way to truly understand something is to take it apart and rebuild it yourself.</p>
<h2><a href="#how-we-approach-this" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="how-we-approach-this"></a>How We Approach This</h2>
<ul>
<li>Not just “what” but “how” and “why”. We’re here to understand what we write, not just follow tutorials.</li>
<li>No single track. Backend, frontend, problem-solving, automation - whatever interests us, we’ll explore.</li>
<li>We stand on the shoulders of giants. Our projects won’t always be original, and that’s the point.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="#the-journey-starts-now" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="the-journey-starts-now"></a>The Journey Starts Now</h2>
<p>From here, we jump right in. No predefined order, no rigid path - just a series of projects
that challenge, teach, and (hopefully) inspire.</p>
<p>If that sounds like your kind of thing, <strong>subscribe</strong>, check out the blog, and let’s start building.</p>
